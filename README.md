                                     OVERVIEW SECTION
     ========================================================================================= -->
## Overview

Analysis of Algorithm (CSC402) and Analysis of Algorithm Lab (CSL401) are core subjects in the Second Year (Semester IV) of the Computer Engineering curriculum at the University of Mumbai. These courses establish the foundational understanding of algorithm design, analysis techniques, and optimization strategies crucial for developing efficient computational solutions.

### Course Topics

The curriculum encompasses several key domains in algorithm theory and application:

- **Algorithm Design Techniques**: Divide and Conquer, Greedy Method, Dynamic Programming, and Backtracking
- **Algorithm Analysis**: Time complexity, space complexity, and asymptotic notation (Big-O, Omega, Theta)
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort
- **Searching Algorithms**: Binary Search, Linear Search, and advanced search techniques
- **Graph Algorithms**: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and shortest path algorithms
- **String Matching**: Pattern matching algorithms and string processing
- **NP-Completeness**: Complexity classes (P, NP, NP-Complete, NP-Hard) and reduction techniques
- **Advanced Topics**: Floyd-Warshall, Longest Common Subsequence (LCS), and optimization problems

### Repository Purpose

This repository represents a curated collection of study materials, reference books, assignments, and personal preparation notes compiled during my academic journey. The primary motivation for creating and maintaining this archive is simple yet profound: **to preserve knowledge for continuous learning and future reference**.

As I progress in my career, I recognize that algorithmic fundamentals remain essential for software engineering, competitive programming, and technical interviews. This repository serves as my intellectual reference point: a resource I can return to for relearning concepts, reviewing methodologies, and strengthening understanding when needed.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To maintain organized access to comprehensive study materials beyond the classroom.
- **Continuous Learning**: To support lifelong learning by enabling easy revisitation of fundamental algorithm concepts.
- **Academic Documentation**: To authentically document my learning journey through AOA and AOA Lab.
- **Community Contribution**: To share these resources with students and learners who may benefit from them.

All materials in this repository were gathered, organized, and documented by me during my undergraduate studies (2018-2022) as part of my coursework and exam preparation.

> [!NOTE]
> **COVID-19 Impact**: This coursework was completed during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Due to the nationwide lockdown and the sudden transition to online learning, several planned laboratory sessions and collaborative note-taking activities could not be carried out as originally intended. Despite these challenges, efforts were made to adapt and preserve as much work as possible. The limited chapter notes in this section reflect the disruption caused by the pandemic, rather than a lack of effort or commitment.

> [!TIP]
> **Algorithm Visualization**: Always trace your algorithm's execution flow on paper before coding. Draw recursion trees for divide-and-conquer approaches, create tables for dynamic programming solutions, and visualize array/pointer states at each step. Dry running with small test cases and manually calculating time/space complexity is the most effective way to master algorithm design paradigms and optimize computational efficiency.
